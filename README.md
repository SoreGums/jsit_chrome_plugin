jsit_chrome_plugin
==================

A Google Chrome plugin to simplify uploading torrents to justseed.it.

It will try to add new icons to whatever tracker website that allow one-click uploads to JSIT. If it doesn't work, right-click on a torrent download link and 
choose JSIT-Uploader -> Learn pattern twice and it will try to guess what the pattern ia for the site you're looking at. Please consider submitting your pattern as an enhancement request here. If you have a site that still doesn't work, just submit it as an issue here or by mail to touch_tone@mail.com.

It is now in the Google App Store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsit-uploader/mnjnileinmmcioblmhbgfaikgecolgbo .
